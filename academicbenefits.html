<p>Academic Benefits in college are things that can help improve your academic life. Examples of this are things such as a library or tutoring center because both of these are dedicated to academic improvement. At Prairie View we happen to have both of these things and more, such as computer labs and a good amount of office hours with teachers. </p> </div>
<div class="text2"><h2>Tech Benefits</h2>
    <div class="laptop"><img src="laptop.jpeg"></div><p>The tech benefits at a college are the amount of access to electronic devices or programs that students can get from attending the school. Prairie View does have a variety of technological benefits such as the computer lab, the extensive e-library, and the ability to rent out laptops on campus.These benefits help students complete their work without having to purchase these resources personally. </p></div>
