            <h2>Life on Campus</h2>
            <img src="kappa.jpeg" alt="PVAMU Campus Life">
            <p>Life on campus at Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU) is vibrant, energetic, and deeply rooted in tradition and community spirit. Students enjoy a lively campus atmosphere filled with cultural events, Greek life, student organizations, and weekend activities that bring everyone together.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Welcome to the Hill</h2>
            <img src="hill.jpeg" alt="Welcome to the Hill">
            <p>From homecoming celebrations and “The Hill” gatherings to events hosted by the Marching Storm Band and the Panther Dolls, PVAMU offers countless opportunities to connect, network, and have fun. The university’s strong sense of pride and family fosters friendships that often last well beyond graduation, making PVAMU not just a place to learn, but a place to truly belong.</p>

            <h2>The Swac</h2>
            <img src="prairieviewfootball.jpeg" alt="The Southwestern Atletic Conference (SWAC)">
            <p>With recent improvements in facilities and a program on the rise, now could be an exciting time to get involved—whether cheering from the stands, attending game-day events, or even considering roles in student-media or athletics support. As a student at PVAMU, you have the opportunity to build relationships, network, and participate in one of the signature experiences on campus. The Panthers’ resurgence makes going to games or following the season a way to be part of something bigger.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The MSC</h2>
            <img src="mscproject.jpeg" alt="The MSC">
            <p>The central point of student life, many of the “social hub” activities happen there. It’s more than just a cafeteria: the MSC is a multipurpose building serving academic, social, and administrative needs. For meal plans, MSC dining is a major option for students living on campus. For student engagement, it's a go-to for meetings, events, and student org offices.</p>
