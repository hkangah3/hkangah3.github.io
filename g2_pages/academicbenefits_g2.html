        <h2>Academic Benefits</h2>
        <p>Academic benefits are the things that can help a student's academic success, such as improving their grades or giving them the knowledge to succeed after college. A few examples of the benefits that Prairie View offers are the John B. Coleman Library, a successful tutoring and writing center, and there are advisors that seminars somewhat often that can help students with planning their academic or professional future.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tcb">
        <h2>Tech Benefits</h2>
        <p>The tech benefits at a college are the amount of access to electronic devices or programs that students can get from attending the school. These technological benefits are good because they allow for students to learn in different ways, for example if students have circumstances that make it difficult for them to go to classes physically they may be able to take the class online instead.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        <div class="libra"><img src="library.jpeg" width="40%" height="auto"></div>
        <p>This is the library at Prairie view, and here students can enter at any time before 12 am to meet with others and study in a dedicated location. Here you can get tutoring in subjects that you are struggling with, or get help with writing your essays from professionals and approved students. There are also specific study rooms so that you can stay in a location that is made to help student's study more effectively without a lot of distractions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text2">
        <div class="chart"><img src="techchart.png" width="100%" height="auto"></div>
        <p>Prairie View does have a variety of technological benefits such as the computer lab, and an extensive e-library. students at Prairie View can also print paper as much as they want because you get a lot of printing credit every semester, more than anybody could reasonably use in this amount of time. Prairie Views extensive connections in the tech industry are also a type of tech benefit because it can help students get familiar with or find opportunities while in college. This is exemplified by events like "Tech Town" which is a sort of career fair that is specifically for engineering students.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text3">
        <div class="info"><img src="infosession.jpeg" width="50%" height="auto"></div>
        <p>On campus there are advisors that will host info sessions such as master's informationals which will give students information about what goes into pursuing higher master's level education. There are also academic advisors that will host informationals to help newer students get used to college life, or tell them things like how to sign up for their classes because it can be confusing initially. There are also occasionally companies or alumni that can come to campus to talk to students about post graduate life and opportunities. These are just a few of the ways that students can get extra information on campus to improve their academic life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text4">
        <div class="laptop"><img src="laptop.jpeg" width="60%" height="auto"></div>
        <p>Prairie View does offer the opportunity to rent out laptops if you may need it. These laptops are helpful because they can be expensive to buy on your own, but a lot of classes require work to be done online instead of on paper. Some teachers may be able to or may try to work with you but it is becoming more of a standard to make work online focused. This makes the opportunity to rent out computers a positive because you can save money since to rent out the laptops you just need to put in your prairie view information to log in and you can use it for a set amount of time.</p>
