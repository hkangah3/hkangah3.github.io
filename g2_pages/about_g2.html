<h2><center>Purpose</center></h2>

<p>
We are a group that is here to show everyone what they will get along with their tuition here at Prairieview A&M University. 
For those joining us, they may not realize everything that they get here at our institution. Sure, you may get some of the 
basics like food and housing, but we offer so much more than that and want to show people everything that we offer. 
Ranging from buses to health benefits, we want to show everything that Prairieview has to offer so students can make the 
most out of their tuition.
